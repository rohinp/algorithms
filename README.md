#Algorithms

It's basically solution for most of the algorithms which are covered in Coursera Algorithm(I,II) tutorial
Language used for solving the algorithms is Scala.

`Note:` 
1. For details on choice of datastructures used in scala is stated in the respective implementation
2. Most of the datastructures used are wrapped in state monad for composition of mutating operations. 


TODO:
1. update read me with list of algorithms and file locations in project
1. Refactor file input operation to be generic, can be used by other algorithms
1. Refactor Main execution, to give a cmd line option to choose which algorithm to execute
    1. Display input, output and analysis.
